# Cimino DML
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). In this case, I worked with MySQL. 
SQL is essential for interacting with relational databases, making it a fundamental skill for database management and data analysis. 
I used DML (Data Manipulation Language), including commands like SELECT, INSERT, and JOIN to query and modify data in the database.
